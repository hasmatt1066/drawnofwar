### 5. **Feature Specifications (docs/FEATURE-SPECIFICATIONS.md)** - âœ… UPDATED
- **Battle State Management**: Territorial wave phases and timing
- **Socket.io Events**: Complete redesign for territorial system
- **Data Structures**: Territory state, lane state, wave coordination
- **Victory Conditions**: Immediate and territorial victory mechanics

### 6. **API Specification (docs/api/complete-api-spec.md)** - âœ… UPDATED
- **Territorial Battle APIs**: Create, join, wave management
- **Territory Control**: Real-time state tracking
- **Cross-Lane Actions**: Flanking and support APIs
- **Socket.io Events**: Territorial control updates
- **Error Handling**: Territorial-specific error codes

### 7. **Session Memory (.claude/session-memory.md)** - âœ… UPDATED
- **System Understanding**: Documented territorial wave combat
- **Implementation Priorities**: Updated for territorial UI
- **Technical Requirements**: Performance targets for territorial system

## ðŸŽ¯ KEY SYSTEM CHANGES DOCUMENTED

### **Core Game Loop (REVISED)**
```typescript
// OLD SYSTEM (Removed)
interface OldBattleSystem {
  deployment: '2 creatures per wave across 2 different lanes'
  timing: { deploymentPhase: 30, combatPhase: 45, resultsPhase: 10 }
  victory: 'Win 2 out of 3 lanes per wave, best of 3 waves'
  battlefield: 'Static 3D hexagonal arena'
}

// NEW SYSTEM (Implemented in Documentation)
interface NewTerritorialSystem {
  deployment: '1 creature per wave, deploys in 2 selected lanes simultaneously'
  timing: { waveInterval: 180, totalWaves: 5, matchDuration: 900 }
  victory: 'Capture all 3 lanes (100% each) OR most territory after 5 waves'
  battlefield: 'Wide territorial battlefield with real-time color control'
  advancement: 'Automatic creature movement toward enemy base'
  reinforcement: 'Waves can stack in same lanes for cooperative combat'
}
```

### **Critical Mechanical Changes**
1. **Wave Structure**: 180-second waves (not 30-45 second phases)
2. **Deployment**: 1 creature â†’ 2 lanes simultaneously (not 2 creatures â†’ 2 different lanes)
3. **Battlefield**: Wide territorial (not compact arena)
4. **Victory**: Territorial control (not lane victories)
5. **Timing**: 15-minute matches (not 5-minute matches)
6. **Strategy**: Multi-wave coordination with persistent territory

### **UI/UX Requirements Added**
- Real-time territorial color visualization
- Individual lane control meters (0-100%)
- Aggregate territorial progress bar
- Wave countdown timer (180 seconds)
- Lane selection interface for dual deployment
- Cross-lane interaction indicators

### **Technical Specifications Updated**
- Socket.io events for territorial control
- Real-time territory calculation algorithms
- Multi-creature coordination in lanes
- Cross-lane interaction systems
- Performance optimization for territorial updates

## ðŸ”„ IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

### **Documentation Status: COMPLETE**
All documentation now consistently reflects the territorial wave combat system. The project is ready for Claude Code implementation with:

âœ… **Consistent System Understanding** across all files
âœ… **Detailed Technical Specifications** for territorial mechanics
âœ… **Complete API Definitions** for wave and territory management
âœ… **UI/UX Requirements** for territorial visualization
âœ… **Performance Targets** for real-time territorial system
âœ… **Data Structures** for territorial state management

### **Next Steps for Implementation**
1. **Initialize Next.js Project** with territorial system architecture
2. **Implement Territorial UI Components** (progress bars, color visualization)
3. **Build Territory State Management** (real-time updates, persistence)
4. **Create Wave Management System** (180-second cycles, deployment)
5. **Develop Cross-Lane Interactions** (flanking, ranged support)

### **Critical Success Factors**
- **Territorial Visualization**: Must be clear and responsive (60 FPS)
- **Wave Timing**: 180-second cycles must balance drawing vs. watching
- **Network Performance**: <50ms territorial state synchronization
- **Strategic Depth**: Multiple viable lane strategies and comeback mechanics
