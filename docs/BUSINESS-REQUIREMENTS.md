# üéÆ Business Requirements Document: Drawn of War 2

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Drawn of War 2** is a revolutionary multiplayer battle game that uniquely combines artistic creativity with strategic gameplay. Unlike traditional games, players create their own battle creatures by drawing them, which are then analyzed by advanced AI to generate stats and 3D models for real-time combat.

### Unique Value Proposition
- **First-of-its-kind AI-powered drawing analysis** that converts artwork into battle-ready creatures
- **Proprietary 3D model generation** from 2D drawings using cutting-edge AI
- **Strategic depth** with elemental types, special abilities, and tactical combat
- **Creative expression** as a core gameplay mechanic, not just cosmetic
- **Fair monetization** model that rewards skill and creativity over spending
