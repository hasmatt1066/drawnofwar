## ‚úÖ Keep These Files

- `temp-delete-00/` (was `00-PROJECT-OVERVIEW/`)
- `temp-delete-01/` (was `01-ARCHITECTURE/`) 
- `temp-delete-02/` (was `02-TECHNICAL-STACK/`)
- `temp-delete-03/` (was `03-UI-UX-DESIGN/`)

- `temp-delete-08/` (was `08-TESTING-STRATEGY/`)
- `temp-delete-09/` (was `09-DEPLOYMENT/`)
- `temp-delete-10/` (was `10-REFERENCE/`)

## üéØ Result: Clean Documentation Structure

After cleanup, you'll have a clean, organized documentation structure with:
- Logical grouping by topic area
- No redundant numbered directories
- All essential content preserved in the organized structure
- Easy navigation and maintenance

## üìù Next Steps
1. Delete all `temp-delete-*` directories manually
2. The remaining structure will be clean and organized
3. All documentation is preserved in the topic-based directories
