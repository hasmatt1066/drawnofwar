# ADR-004: UI-First Development Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-04

## Context
After completing the initial project setup (Next.js, TypeScript, folder structure, and basic components), we need to decide on the development approach for building Drawn of War 2. The main options are:

1. **Backend-first**: Build APIs, database, and services before UI
2. **UI-first**: Build the user interface with mock data before backend
3. **Parallel**: Build UI and backend simultaneously
4. **Feature-vertical**: Complete full slices (UI + backend) per feature

## Decision
We will proceed with a **UI-first development approach**, building the user interface with mock data and services before implementing the actual backend functionality.

## Rationale

### Benefits of UI-First Approach:
1. **Visual Feedback**: Stakeholders can see and interact with the game concept early
2. **User Experience Validation**: Test and iterate on UX before committing to backend implementation
3. **Design Pattern Establishment**: Create consistent UI patterns and component library upfront
4. **Clearer Requirements**: UI implementation often reveals hidden requirements and edge cases
5. **Parallel Development Ready**: Backend can be built to match validated UI requirements

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces already defined in `/src/types/index.ts`
2. **Mock Service Layer**: Create service interfaces that return realistic mock data
3. **Loading/Error States**: Build these states into every component from the start
4. **Modular Architecture**: Keep UI components pure and business logic separate
5. **Integration Checkpoints**: Plan regular points to connect real APIs as they become available

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core UI Shell (Current)
- Navigation and layout structure
- Landing page with game overview
- Authentication UI (login/register)
- User dashboard

### Phase 2: Game UI Components
- Drawing canvas interface
- Battle arena visualization
- Creature gallery
- Tournament brackets

### Phase 3: Integration
- Replace mock services with real APIs
- Add WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Integrate Firebase Authentication
- Connect to payment systems

### Mock Service Structure
```typescript
// Example mock service pattern
interface DrawingService {
  analyzeDrawing(imageData: string): Promise<CreatureStats>;
  saveDrawing(drawing: DrawingData): Promise<Creature>;
}

class MockDrawingService implements DrawingService {
  async analyzeDrawing(imageData: string): Promise<CreatureStats> {
    // Return realistic mock data
    await delay(1500); // Simulate API delay
    return generateMockCreatureStats();
  }
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Faster initial development and stakeholder feedback
- Better UX through early testing and iteration
- Clear visual reference for backend development
- Reduced risk of building wrong features
- Easier onboarding for new developers (they can see the app)

### Negative:
- Risk of API contract mismatches (mitigated by TypeScript)
- Potential refactoring when connecting real backend
- May create unrealistic performance expectations
- Need to maintain mock data generators

### Neutral:
- Requires discipline to not over-engineer UI before backend validation
- Mock services need to be realistic to avoid surprises
- Loading and error states must be considered upfront

## Review Criteria
We will review this decision after completing Phase 1 (Core UI Shell) to ensure:
- The approach is delivering expected benefits
- Mock services are adequate for development
- No significant technical debt is accumulating
- The team can maintain development velocity
