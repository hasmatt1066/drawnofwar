# ADR-001: Frontend Framework Choice

## Status
**Accepted** - 2024-01-15

## Context

Drawn of War 2 requires a modern, performant frontend framework that can handle:
- Complex real-time drawing canvas with touch support
- Real-time multiplayer battle interface
- Responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- TypeScript support for type safety
- Large-scale application architecture

### Options Considered

1. **React with Create React App**
   - Pros: Familiar, large ecosystem, flexible
   - Cons: No SSR, build configuration complexity, performance limitations

2. **Vue.js with Nuxt.js**
   - Pros: Excellent developer experience, built-in SSR, good performance
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less TypeScript integration

3. **Angular with Universal**
   - Pros: Full-featured framework, excellent TypeScript support
   - Cons: Steep learning curve, heavy for gaming applications

4. **Next.js with React**
   - Pros: Built-in SSR, excellent performance, great developer experience
   - Cons: React-specific, potential vendor lock-in

5. **SvelteKit**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, small bundle size
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less mature

## Decision

We choose **Next.js 15 with React** for the following reasons:

### Technical Advantages
- **App Router**: New App Router provides better performance and developer experience
- **Server Components**: Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size
- **Built-in Optimization**: Automatic image optimization, code splitting, and caching
- **TypeScript First**: Excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- **API Routes**: Collocated API endpoints for seamless full-stack development

### Gaming-Specific Benefits
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Excellent WebSocket support for multiplayer features
- **Canvas Integration**: Superior HTML5 Canvas performance for drawing features
- **Mobile Optimization**: Outstanding mobile performance and touch handling
- **SEO Requirements**: Built-in SSR for marketing pages and user profiles

### Development Experience
- **Hot Reloading**: Fast development iteration
- **Modern React Features**: Hooks, Suspense, Concurrent Features
- **Deployment**: Seamless Vercel integration
- **Community**: Large community and extensive documentation

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// Project Structure
interface ProjectStructure {
  framework: 'Next.js 15'
  language: 'TypeScript'
  styling: 'Tailwind CSS'
  stateManagement: 'React Query + Zustand'
  components: 'Radix UI + Custom Components'
  testing: 'Jest + React Testing Library'
  linting: 'ESLint + Prettier'
}

// Performance Optimizations
interface PerformanceConfig {
  bundleAnalyzer: true
  imageOptimization: true
  codesplitting: 'route-based + component-based'
  caching: 'aggressive static caching'
  compressionn: 'gzip + brotli'
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Developer Velocity**: Faster development with excellent tooling
- **Performance**: Superior Core Web Vitals scores
- **Scalability**: Handles complex applications with ease
- **Ecosystem**: Access to React's massive ecosystem
- **Future-Proof**: Active development and strong community

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Next.js specific patterns
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to Vercel ecosystem (though not strictly required)
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple React apps
- **Bundle Size**: Larger than minimal frameworks like Svelte

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Training**: Team training on Next.js best practices
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive internal documentation
- **Fallback Plan**: Architecture allows for gradual migration if needed
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular performance audits and optimization

## Alternatives Considered

If Next.js proves problematic, we have these fallback options:
1. **Remix**: Similar SSR capabilities with different approach
2. **Vite + React**: Faster development server, manual SSR setup
3. **T3 Stack**: Next.js with opinionated additional tools

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores > 90
- **Developer Experience**: Feature delivery velocity
- **User Experience**: Core Web Vitals in green
- **Scalability**: Handle 10,000+ concurrent users
