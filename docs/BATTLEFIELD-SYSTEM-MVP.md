  lanes: {
    topLane: {
      position: 'y: 4'
      width: 'Full battlefield width for advancement'
      territorySegments: 100 // 1% territory per segment
      crossLaneAccess: 'Can flank to middle lane'
    }
    middleLane: {
      position: 'y: 0' 
      width: 'Full battlefield width for advancement'
      territorySegments: 100 // 1% territory per segment
      crossLaneAccess: 'Can flank to top or bottom lanes'
    }
    bottomLane: {
      position: 'y: -4'
      width: 'Full battlefield width for advancement'
