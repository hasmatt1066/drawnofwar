## ðŸ”„ Next Steps for Implementation

### Research Priorities
1. **Deep dive into Tldraw's collaboration architecture** - understand operational transformation
2. **Study real-time presence systems** - research user awareness and cursor tracking
3. **Research drawing data optimization** - investigate compression and batching techniques
4. **Investigate mobile touch optimization** - ensure smooth collaborative drawing on mobile

### Custom Development Areas
1. **Drawing-while-watching mechanics** - unique dual-mode interface for our game
2. **Wave-synchronized drawing** - coordinate drawing phases with battle waves
3. **Conflict resolution for game context** - adapt collaboration for competitive drawing
4. **Mobile-optimized collaborative interface** - ensure smooth mobile experience

### Testing and Validation
1. **Collaboration stress testing** - validate performance with multiple simultaneous users
2. **Network condition testing** - test collaboration under various network conditions
3. **Mobile device testing** - ensure collaborative drawing works on target devices
4. **Conflict resolution testing** - validate operational transformation accuracy

*These examples provide proven patterns for real-time collaborative drawing that can be adapted for our unique drawing-while-battling system. Focus on understanding the core principles of operational transformation, conflict resolution, and network optimization rather than copying implementations directly.*
