Plan the implementation approach for a specific feature or task.

Usage: /plan [feature/task description]

Follow these steps:
1. **Understand Requirements**: 
   - Review the feature specifications in docs/
   - Identify acceptance criteria and constraints
   - Check dependencies on other components

2. **Break Down the Task**:
   - Split into 2-4 hour implementable chunks
   - Identify specific deliverables for each chunk
   - Note any research or setup required

3. **Identify Technical Approach**:
   - Choose appropriate technologies and patterns
   - Consider error handling and edge cases
   - Plan testing strategy

4. **Create Implementation Plan**:
   - Prioritize tasks by dependencies
   - Estimate effort for each subtask
   - Identify potential blockers

5. **Document the Plan**:
   - Add detailed breakdown to session memory
   - Update project progress tracker
   - Note any architectural decisions made

Use "think harder" to ensure thorough analysis of complex features.

Examples:
- /plan drawing canvas with undo/redo
- /plan real-time battle synchronization
- /plan AI integration with fallback system
