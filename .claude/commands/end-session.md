   - Note any new blockers or dependencies

3. **Capture Context**:
   - Document key implementation decisions made
   - Save any useful code patterns or solutions
   - Note debugging insights or gotchas discovered
   - Record any architectural learnings

4. **Plan Next Session**:
   - Identify the next highest priority task
   - Note any setup or preparation needed
   - Document specific next steps to take

5. **Session Summary**:
