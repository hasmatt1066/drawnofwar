Review the current session memory and project documentation to understand where we are in the implementation.

Follow these steps:
1. Read .claude/session-memory.md to understand current context
2. Review docs/PROJECT-PROGRESS.md to see task status
3. Check CLAUDE.md for any updated instructions
4. Identify the next highest priority task based on:
   - Project phase priorities
   - Dependencies and blockers
   - Implementation complexity
5. Provide a clear summary of:
   - What has been completed
   - What is currently in progress  
   - What should be tackled next
   - Any blockers or dependencies to address

This helps maintain context between sessions and ensures we always know the next step.
